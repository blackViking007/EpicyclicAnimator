# EpicyclicAnimator
This repo is an implementation of reconstructing 2-D sequential point clouds using Fourier series. This is based off [this](https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/a/171756) answer on stackexchange. The original code has been done is mathematica, and this is a python 2.7 implementation.

The notebook [Epicycles.ipynb](Epicycles.ipynb) is self-explanatory, with comments at relevant places.

#### Testing

The following images in assets/ seem to work without a hitch: [Eli](assets/Eli.png) and [Groot](assets/Groot4.png). The remaining need to be validated. I shall, tomorrow, if I am not snapped.
